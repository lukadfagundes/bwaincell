# Trinity Method SDK Bug Report

## Command Visibility Issue with Frontmatter Fields

**Report ID:** TRINITY-SDK-BUG-001
**Severity:** Medium
**Category:** Slash Command System
**Affected Component:** `.claude/commands/*.md` frontmatter parsing
**Reported By:** Bwaincell Project (Discord.js Bot)
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Trinity Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Executive Summary

Trinity slash commands with `alwaysShow: false` or `globs: []` fields in their frontmatter do not appear in the Claude Code command palette, despite the command files being properly installed and accessible. This prevents users from discovering and executing affected commands.

---

## Issue Description

### Problem Statement

The `/trinity-orchestrate` command was installed correctly in `.claude/commands/trinity-orchestrate.md` but did not appear in the Claude Code command palette when typing `/trinity` or searching for Trinity commands. All other Trinity commands (24 total) appeared correctly.

### Root Cause

The command's frontmatter included optional fields (`globs: []` and `alwaysShow: false`) that caused the command to be filtered out or hidden from the command palette.

**Problematic Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
description: Orchestrate implementation using AJ MAESTRO and 11-agent team
globs: []
alwaysShow: false
---
```

**Working Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
description: Orchestrate implementation using AJ MAESTRO and 11-agent team
---
```

---

## Impact Assessment

### User Impact

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Affected Users:** All users with Trinity Method SDK v1.0.0
- **User Experience:** Command discovery failure - users cannot find or execute `/trinity-orchestrate`
- **Workaround:** Manual editing of command file frontmatter

### System Impact

- **Functional Impact:** One of 25 Trinity commands is effectively disabled
- **Data Impact:** None (read-only command visibility issue)
- **Performance Impact:** None

### Affected Commands in Trinity SDK

Based on this pattern, any Trinity command with the following frontmatter patterns may be affected:

- Commands with `alwaysShow: false`
- Commands with `globs: []`
- Commands with any non-standard frontmatter fields beyond `description`

---

## Technical Details

### Environment

- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **IDE:** VS Code with Claude Code extension
- **Project Type:** Discord.js 14.14.1 + Express 4.21.2 (Hybrid Bot)
- **Node Version:** 16.9.0+
- **Trinity Version:** 1.0.0

### Reproduction Steps

1. Install Trinity Method SDK v1.0.0
2. Navigate to `.claude/commands/`
3. Create a command file with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Test command
   globs: []
   alwaysShow: false
   ---
   ```
4. Open Claude Code command palette
5. Type `/test` or search for the command
6. **Expected:** Command appears in palette
7. **Actual:** Command does not appear

### Verification

**Before Fix:**

- Command file exists: ✅ `.claude/commands/trinity-orchestrate.md`
- Command file readable: ✅ Claude can read the file
- Command appears in palette: ❌ Not visible
- Other Trinity commands work: ✅ 24/25 commands visible

**After Fix (removing `globs` and `alwaysShow`):**

- Command file exists: ✅ `.claude/commands/trinity-orchestrate.md`
- Command file readable: ✅ Claude can read the file
- Command appears in palette: ✅ **Now visible**
- Other Trinity commands work: ✅ 25/25 commands visible

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Likely Causes

1. **`alwaysShow: false` Interpretation**
   - Claude Code may interpret this as "never show in command palette"
   - Intended behavior unclear (show only in specific contexts?)
   - No documentation on this field's behavior

2. **`globs: []` Empty Array**
   - Empty glob array may signal "no file contexts match"
   - May prevent command from appearing in global palette
   - Unclear if empty array is semantically different from omitting field

3. **Frontmatter Schema Strictness**
   - Claude Code may only support specific frontmatter fields
   - Unknown fields may cause command registration to fail silently
   - No validation errors or warnings shown to user

### Supporting Evidence

**Working Commands Pattern:**
All 24 visible Trinity commands use minimal frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: <command description>
---
```

**Non-Working Command Pattern:**
The invisible command used extended frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: <command description>
globs: []
alwaysShow: false
---
```

---

## Recommended Fixes

### Short-Term Fix (Immediate - Applied)

**Action:** Remove problematic frontmatter fields from Trinity SDK deployment

**Files to Update:**

- `.claude/commands/trinity-orchestrate.md`
- Any other commands with `globs: []` or `alwaysShow: false`

**Change:**

```diff
---
description: Orchestrate implementation using AJ MAESTRO and 11-agent team
- globs: []
- alwaysShow: false
---
```

**Status:** ✅ Applied to Bwaincell project, verified working

---

### Medium-Term Fix (Trinity SDK v1.0.1)

**Recommendation 1: Update Trinity Deployment Templates**

Update all Trinity command templates to use minimal frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: <command description>
---
```

**Affected Files in SDK:**

- `trinity-hooks/deploy.sh` (or deployment script)
- Command template files
- Trinity documentation

**Recommendation 2: Document Frontmatter Schema**

Create documentation specifying supported frontmatter fields:

- `description` (required) - Command description shown in palette
- Document any other supported fields with examples
- Specify behavior of optional fields

**Recommendation 3: Add Validation**

Add validation to Trinity deployment process:

- Check for unsupported frontmatter fields
- Warn users about potentially problematic fields
- Validate command files during `trinity deploy`

---

### Long-Term Fix (Trinity SDK v2.0)

**Recommendation 1: Claude Code SDK Enhancement Request**

File enhancement request with Claude Code team:

- Request documentation of supported frontmatter fields
- Request validation errors for malformed frontmatter
- Request `alwaysShow` behavior clarification
- Request `globs` field documentation with examples

**Recommendation 2: Trinity Command Validation Tool**

Create `trinity-validate-commands` tool:

```bash
# Validate all command files
/trinity-validate-commands

# Output:
# ✅ trinity-agents.md - Valid frontmatter
# ✅ trinity-init.md - Valid frontmatter
# ⚠️  trinity-orchestrate.md - Unknown field: alwaysShow
# ⚠️  trinity-orchestrate.md - Unknown field: globs
```

**Recommendation 3: Automated Testing**

Add automated tests to Trinity SDK:

- Verify all 25 Trinity commands are discoverable
- Test command palette registration
- Validate frontmatter schema compliance

---

## Prevention Measures

### For Trinity SDK Maintainers

1. **Standard Template:** Use minimal frontmatter in all command templates
2. **Documentation:** Document supported frontmatter fields clearly
3. **Testing:** Test command discovery in fresh installations
4. **Validation:** Add command file validation to deployment scripts

### For Trinity Users

1. **Minimal Frontmatter:** Only use `description` field unless documented
2. **Verification:** Run `/trinity-verify` to check command visibility
3. **Testing:** Test command palette after deployment
4. **Reporting:** Report invisible commands to Trinity SDK team

## Related Issues

### Potential Related Issues in Trinity SDK

Based on this discovery, review other Trinity commands for similar issues:

```bash
# Check all Trinity commands for problematic frontmatter
grep -r "alwaysShow" .claude/commands/trinity-*.md
grep -r "globs:" .claude/commands/trinity-*.md
```

**Commands to Audit:**

- All 25 Trinity commands
- Any custom project-specific commands
- Future command additions

**Summary:** 25/25 commands now visible after fix

### C. Supported Frontmatter Fields (Inferred)

Based on working commands, the following frontmatter schema is recommended:

**Required Fields:**

- `description: string` - Command description for palette

**Optional Fields (Use with Caution):**

- Unknown - no other fields documented or tested

**Fields to Avoid:**

- `alwaysShow: boolean` - Causes command to be hidden
- `globs: array` - May cause command to be hidden if empty
