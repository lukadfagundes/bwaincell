## What is Trinity Method?

Trinity Method is an investigation-first development methodology that emphasizes:

- **Understanding before implementing** - Deep investigation precedes all code changes
- **Strategic planning over reactive coding** - Comprehensive planning prevents technical debt
- **Quality and maintainability from the start** - Built-in quality gates ensure excellence
- **Knowledge capture and reuse** - All discoveries documented for future reference

## Core Principles

### 1. Investigate First

**Never code before understanding.**

- Analyze the problem thoroughly
- Identify root causes, not symptoms
- Research existing solutions and patterns
- Document findings before implementation
- Time-box investigations (default: 2 hours)

### 2. Document Thoroughly

**Knowledge is a project asset.**

- Keep knowledge base current and accurate
- Document all architectural decisions
- Record patterns for reuse
- Maintain issue database with solutions
- Archive session learnings

### 3. Archive Sessions

**Progress tracking matters.**

- Every session archived in `trinity/sessions/`
- Session summaries capture key decisions
- Patterns extracted from sessions
- Continuity between sessions maintained
- Historical reference available

### 4. Quality Focus

**Maintainability over speed.**

- Code quality gates enforced
- Technical debt tracked and managed
- Pattern-based development
- Comprehensive testing required
- Regular audits conducted

---

## Starting a Session

### Initial Context Loading

When starting work with Trinity Method:

1. **Load Project Context**
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` for project overview
   - Review recent git history and changes
   - Check current branch and status

2. **Review Knowledge Base**
   - `trinity/knowledge-base/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design
   - `trinity/knowledge-base/To-do.md` - Current tasks
   - `trinity/knowledge-base/ISSUES.md` - Known issues
   - `trinity/knowledge-base/Technical-Debt.md` - Debt status

3. **Understand Current State**
   - Check for uncommitted changes
   - Review recent commits
   - Assess system health
   - Identify blockers

## Bwaincell-Specific Guidelines

### Discord.js Development Patterns

#### Critical Interaction Handling

```typescript
// ALWAYS defer interactions immediately
if (interaction.isChatInputCommand()) {
  await interaction.deferReply();
  // Now you have 15 minutes to respond
}

// Check interaction state before responding
if (interaction.deferred) {
  await interaction.editReply(response);
} else if (!interaction.replied) {
  await interaction.reply(response);
}
```

#### Error Recovery

```typescript
// Handle Discord error codes
const errorCode = (error as any)?.code;
if (errorCode === 10062) {
  // Unknown interaction
  logger.warn('Interaction expired');
  return; // Don't attempt response
}
```

### Database Patterns

#### User Data Isolation

```typescript
// Always filter by user_id + guild_id
const tasks = await Task.findAll({
  where: {
    user_id: userId,
    guild_id: guildId,
  },
});
```

#### Transaction Safety

```typescript
// Use transactions for multi-step operations
const transaction = await sequelize.transaction();
try {
  await Model1.create(data1, { transaction });
  await Model2.update(data2, { transaction });
  await transaction.commit();
} catch (error) {
  await transaction.rollback();
  throw error;
}
```

### Type Safety Standards

#### Avoid `any` Types

```typescript
// Bad - loses type safety
const result: any = await someFunction();

// Good - maintain type safety
interface Result {
  id: number;
  data: string;
}
const result: Result = await someFunction();
```

## Investigation Protocol

### Starting an Investigation

1. **Define Scope**
   - What exactly needs investigation?
   - What are the success criteria?
   - What is the time limit?

2. **Gather Evidence**
   - Review existing code
   - Check logs and error messages
   - Examine database state
   - Search knowledge base for patterns

3. **Analyze Findings**
   - Identify root cause
   - Consider multiple solutions
   - Evaluate trade-offs
   - Document decision rationale

4. **Document Results**
   - Create investigation record in `trinity/investigations/`
   - Update ISSUES.md if issues found
   - Extract patterns to `trinity/patterns/`
   - Update ARCHITECTURE.md if architectural

### Investigation Time Boxing

| Investigation Type     | Default Time Limit |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Quick Research         | 30 minutes         |
| Standard Investigation | 2 hours            |
| Deep Dive              | 4 hours            |
| Architectural Analysis | 8 hours            |

## Issue Management

### Issue Lifecycle (INO Specialty)

1. **Discovered** - Issue identified in codebase
2. **Investigated** - Root cause analyzed
3. **Documented** - Added to ISSUES.md
4. **Prioritized** - Severity assigned (P0-P3)
5. **Resolved** - Fix implemented and tested
6. **Verified** - Solution confirmed working
7. **Pattern Extracted** - Reusable pattern documented
8. **Closed** - Knowledge captured and archived

### Issue Categories

- **P0 - Critical** - Blocking functionality or data loss
- **P1 - High** - Significant impact on user experience
- **P2 - Medium** - Quality issues affecting maintainability
- **P3 - Low** - Minor improvements and optimizations

---

## Knowledge Base Maintenance

### Regular Updates Required

| File              | Update Frequency            | Maintainer |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| CLAUDE.md         | After major changes         | INO        |
| ISSUES.md         | Every session               | INO        |
| ARCHITECTURE.md   | After architectural changes | ZEN        |
| Technical-Debt.md | Weekly                      | TAN        |
| To-do.md          | Daily                       | Aly        |
| Trinity.md        | Monthly                     | ZEN        |
